## Testing 

### The browser compatibility
* The testing runs testing for Chrome, Opera, Microsoft Edge, Safari and Firefox for Heroku app. I found the Chrome, Opera and Micosoft Edge, it does not great visual while you are playing game. I would not recommand to use those.

* I am finding the Safari and Firefox, it does very clear visual while the playing. I would recommand to use Safari or Firefox.

### The devices

* I was testing on my iphone and seem it does not working at all but my mention Rory does working on his mobile device.

### The test running game in Heroku app

* Almost the function works except the check_draw does not working because I want to see prompt "it's tie on the screen when it was tie. 

* It was working before when I asked tutor because I found it have some glitch and I want to solution check_draw. we tried to figure it out what was problem. Unforunately, my time allowance was hit up. I ran to fix sereval times and could not find solution. My deadline was so closed then I stop to fix and move on to do ReadMe.

* The Branch under to open to main and root then click to save. 
* It ran the deployment processing while it is successful.

The site lives at [Movie Quiz](https://rqisl.github.io/portfolio-project-2-robert-quinlan/)

## Credits

I was nervous to do projects because I had experienced how difficult through javascript where I studied for Multimedia BA degree. I started project 2, I found it was extremely difficult all over again. My concept was before start developing the site and turn out I was not able to full completed which are get result, age group and time up game. I had spend to learning other resource a lot of time. I tried to understand the javascript but I was disppointed because I could not understand what they have explaining. Cause it was not my first English language. 

My mentor had good feedback and helps with my process improvement on site project.

## Adobe Photoshop & Illustrate

* The logo images where I created the Photoshop. I downloaded the image comes from [www.vecteezy.com](https://www.vecteezy.com/vector-art/19115573-creative-business-card-and-logo-template-album-film-movie-reel-vector-illustration). It is free licence. I choose a roll movie image and edited to create a logo where I used Adobe Illustrate. 
* The layout movie poster on the front page which comes from [www.wallpaperflare.com/](www.wallpaperflare.com/), It is free to allow download who wish to use wallpaper on the usernames' desktop, laptop, tablet or mobile.
* I downloaded three movie posters:
    - [Matrix](https://www.wallpaperflare.com/the-matrix-poster-movies-neo-keanu-reeves-morpheus-carrie-anne-moss-wallpaper-mjcss/download/1920x1200)
